            <h4>Healthy Food</h4>
            <p>Healthy eating is not about strict limitations, staying unrealistically thin, or depriving yourself of
              the foods you love. Rather, it’s about eating well-balanced meals that leave you feeling great, having
              more energy, improving your health, and boosting your mood.</p>
            <p>Healthy eating doesn’t have to be overly complicated. If you feel overwhelmed by all the conflicting
              nutrition and diet advice out there, you’re not alone. It seems that for every expert who tells you a
              certain food is good for you, you’ll find another saying exactly the opposite. The truth is that while
              some specific foods or nutrients have been shown to have a beneficial effect on mood, it’s your overall
              dietary pattern that is most important. </p>
            <p>Eating healthy food is crucial for several reasons:</p>
          </div>
          <div id="item-1-1">
            <h5>Nutritional Benefits: </h5>
            <p>Healthy foods are rich in essential nutrients like vitamins, minerals, protein, fiber, and healthy fats.
              These nutrients are vital for the body's growth, repair, and overall function.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="item-1-2">
            <h5>Disease Prevention</h5>
            <p>A balanced diet helps reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain
              cancers by maintaining proper bodily functions and reducing inflammation.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="item-1-3">
            <h5>Weight Management</h5>
            <p>Consuming nutrient-dense foods helps maintain a healthy weight, reducing the risk of obesity and related
              health issues.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="item-1-2">
            <h5>Digestive and Immune Health</h5>
            <p> High-fiber foods promote a healthy digestive system, while vitamins and minerals boost immune function,
              helping the body fight infections.</p>
          </div>
          <br><br>
          <div id="item-2">
            <h4>Embracing a Healthier Lifestyle:</h4>
            <p> The Benefits of Switching to a Nutritious Diet </p>
            <p>Switching to a healthy diet is a transformative step towards improving your overall well-being. A
              nutritious diet provides a balanced intake of essential nutrients, including vitamins, minerals, proteins,
              healthy fats, and fiber, which are vital for the body's optimal function. When you focus on consuming
              nutrient-rich foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and nuts, you ensure that your
              body receives the components it needs to maintain energy levels and support various bodily functions.</p>
          </div>
          <br><br>
          <div id="item-3">
            <h4>Revitalize Your Plate: Embracing a Colorful Diet with More Fruits and Vegetables</h4>
            <p>Fruit and vegetables are nutrient dense, which means they are packed with vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and fiber. Focus on eating the recommended daily amount of at least five servings of fruit and vegetables and it will naturally fill you up. A serving is half a cup of raw fruit or veg or a small apple or banana, for example. Most of us need to double the amount we currently eat.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="item-3-1">
            <h5>How to make vegetables tasty</h5>
            <p>While plain salads and steamed veggies can quickly become bland, there are plenty of ways to add taste to your vegetable dishes.</p>
            <p> <strong>Add Colour: </strong>Not only do brighter, deeper colored vegetables contain higher concentrations of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, but they can vary the flavor and make meals more visually appealing. Add color using fresh or sundried tomatoes, glazed carrots or beets, roasted red cabbage wedges, yellow squash, or sweet, colorful peppers.</p>
            <p><strong>Liven up salad greens: </strong> Branch out beyond lettuce. Kale, arugula, spinach, mustard greens, broccoli, and Chinese cabbage are all packed with nutrients. To add flavor to your salad greens, try drizzling with olive oil, adding a spicy dressing, or sprinkling with almond slices, chickpeas, a little bacon, parmesan, or goat cheese.</p>
            <p><strong>Cook green beans, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and asparagus in new ways:</strong> Instead of boiling or steaming these healthy sides, try grilling, roasting, or pan frying them with chili flakes, garlic, shallots, mushrooms, or onion. Or marinate in tangy lemon or lime before cooking.</p>
